// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index),
// which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meters).

// Your task is to write some code to help them:
// Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called massMark, heightMark, massJohn and heightJohn.

// Calculate both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called BMIMark and BMIJohn.
// Log the value of BMIMark and BMIJohn to the console.

// BONUS: Create a boolean variable markHigherBMI containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Log it to the console too

// TEST DATA 1: Marks weighs 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weighs 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
// TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
